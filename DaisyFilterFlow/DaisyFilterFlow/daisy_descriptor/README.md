- Aug 2014, the code under this directory have been slightly modified to fit our framework usage. Primarily, the modification is about precomputing and storing convolved gradient histograms so as to make extracting arbitrary rotated descriptors much faster. It also made calculating the descriptor difference cost much faster.
