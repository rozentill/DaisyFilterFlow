## Usage
Run the `Daisy_Filter_Flow_sample.exe`; under windows, it will prompt a GUI window to load two images, then the algorithm will start calculating the dense correspondences (forward flow) between two images. See `example_DaisyFilterFlow_main.cpp` for detail calling usage.

## Compiled environment
Win7 + Visual Studio 2012 + OpenCV 2.4.8 (prebuilt official version)
